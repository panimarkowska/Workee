#### **Improve the way you manage your employees.**

###### Workee is an HR app that was created to help out employees navigate smoothely within their company - whether they're newbies, managers or just looking for a place to interact.

The inspiration came from observing **everyday's work at a growing company** - with more and more people joining the force it's sometimes difficult to keep up.

Workee's aim is to **create an enviroment where employees can log in and share**:
*  what is their daily scope of tasks
*  what exciting or important news they possibly have
*  if they're actually available at work or not 
*  ..and much more.

Providing such information will help all employees to stay informed and up to date - with Workee they will know to whom to reach out (even in case of the most specific issues), where to find them (by desk's or room's number), if the person they want to get in contact with is at work in the given moment (no need to bother anyone, the only thing to do is to check on the app) and some personal/miscellaneous info about the person, like their hobbies and birthday (networking - not less important!).
